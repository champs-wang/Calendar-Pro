## Screenshots

Captured from a fresh demo vault with sample planner notes. The main screenshots
show full-size planner layouts; the right sidebar planner reuses the monthly
grid in compact form.

## What It Does

- Yearly planner: `12 months x 31 days` overview.
- Monthly grid planner: one-month calendar view with date chips, range bars, holidays, a configurable alternate calendar label, and mobile pinch zoom.
- Monthly list planner: day-by-day list for dense monthly review, with `All`, `With notes`, and `Upcoming` filters.
- Sidebar planner: a compact monthly planner opens in the right sidebar by default, can be revealed from the ribbon or command palette, and can cycle through yearly, monthly grid, and monthly list layouts in the same side leaf.
- Date notes and range notes: recognized by `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYY-MM-DD--YYYY-MM-DD` filenames. By default Diary scans the entire vault, with an optional planner-folder-only scope. Title suffixes can keep visible spaces.
- Plan notes: yearly `{plannerFolder}/{year}.md` and monthly `{plannerFolder}/{year}-{month}.md` notes, with persisted preview state on desktop and separate mobile state.
- Remembered yearly cell width: expanded month-cell widths are saved across reloads.
- Chip metadata: `color`, `todo`, `completed`, `notify_minutes`, `title`, `date_start`, `date_end`, and recurrence frontmatter.
- Recurring events: repeat a note daily, monthly, or yearly with a Gregorian or alternate-calendar basis. Diary materializes only the occurrences inside the planner range you are currently viewing.
- Desktop workflows: right-sidebar companion planner, drag range selection, chip drag-to-move, keyboard activation, internal planner copy/paste/delete/undo.
- Mobile workflows: tap a day to open the day summary sheet, create notes from the sheet, pinch zoom the monthly grid, and adjust mobile spacing in settings.

2. Run **Open monthly planner in sidebar**, **Open monthly planner**, **Open yearly planner**, or **Open monthly list planner** from the command palette.
3. Select a date cell or the add-file button.
4. Choose **Single date** or **Range**, then set the folder, dates, filename, color, todo state, reminder time, and optional repeat frequency/calendar.
